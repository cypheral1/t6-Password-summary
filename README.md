## 🧪 Passwords Tested

| Password               | Strength   | Feedback                       |
|-------------------------|------------|--------------------------------|
| `hello123`             | Very Weak  | Cracked instantly              |
| `Hello1234`            | Weak       | Cracked in hours               |
| `H3ll0!2025`           | Strong     | Years to crack                 |
| `T!mE$@2025_S#cur3`    | Very Strong| Centuries to crack (brute force)|

## 🛡️ Best Practices for Strong Passwords
- Use **12–16+ characters**.  
- Mix **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.  
- Avoid dictionary words and personal details.  
- Use **passphrases** (e.g., `B3tter_Security#2025!`).  
- Never reuse the same password across accounts.

## ⚔️ Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force** → Tries all possible combinations.  
- **Dictionary Attack** → Uses common words & phrases.  
- **Credential Stuffing** → Reuses leaked credentials from data breaches.  
- **Hybrid Attack** → Mixes dictionary words with variations like `Password123!`.

## 📌 Summary
Password complexity **directly impacts security**.  
- Weak/simple passwords can be cracked in **seconds**.  
- Medium-strength passwords last **hours to days**.  
- Strong passwords with **length + symbols + randomness** can resist attacks for **centuries**.
